## QUBO - NN

<p align="center">
  9 problems and their respective QUBO matrices.
</p>

QUBO matrices are used to describe an optimization problem as a matrix such that a Quantum Annealer (such as a D-Wave QA) can solve it.

Now, these matrices are quite an interesting construct.. Thus, a few questions arise:

* Is it possible to classify the problem class based on the QUBO matrix?
* Is it possible to reverse-engineer the problem parameters that led to a QUBO matrix?

Let's find out.

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TYPE, --type TYPE  Type (classify, reverse)
  --eval
  --gendata

### Generating QUBOs for arbitrary problems

This is an example on how to create a MaxCut instance and generate a QUBO matrix for it:

```
>>> graph = networkx.Graph([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5)])
>>> problem = MaxCut(graph)
>>> matrix = problem.gen_qubo_matrix()
[
    [2, -1, -1, 0, 0],
    [-1, 2, 0, -1, 0],
    [-1, 0, 3, -1, -1],
    [0, -1, -1, 3, -1],
    [0, 0, -1, -1, 2]
]
```

The list of problems can be found in `qubo_nn/problems/__init__.py`. Also:

```

    ...
}
```

## Results

The pipeline of interest is as follows.

<img alt="Reverse-engineering pipeline/architecture." src="qubo_nn/plots/architecture.png">

Given some QUBO matrix that was generated using a set of problem parameters, we first classify the problem in step a and then predict the parameters in step b.

### Classification

Using parameter configuration `100_genX` (see `simulations.json`), the average
total misclassification rate over 20 models goes to near zero. The figure
includes the 95% confidence interval. Scrambling QUBOs leads to a nearly
similar effect. Note that this is using a generalized dataset, i.e. the dataset
consists of not just 64x64 QUBO matrices for each problem, but also smaller
sizes such as 32x32. The smaller sizes are zero-padded to the biggest supported
size, which most of the time is 64x64 and in rare cases goes up to 144x144 (for
Quadratic Assignment).

The t-SNE plot for this experiment is shown below.

### Reverse regression

This is preliminary. Some of the problems are easily learned by a neural network regressor. Each line represents 10 models and includes the 95% confidence interval.

### Reversibility

This shows whether we can deduce the parameters that led to a QUBO matrix, given we predicted the problem beforehand.
A lot of the graph based problems are easily reversable since the graph structure is kept intact in the QUBO matrix. Thus we can recreate the graph and other input parameters given a GraphColoring QUBO matrix.

This is still WIP - needs testing. These are hypotheses.

Reversing some problems like Quadratic Knapsack might be possible - an algorithm is an idea, but one could also make their life easy and try fitting a NN model to it.

### Redundancy of QUBOs with AutoEncoders 

The figure below shows that there are major differences between problem classes
in terms of their overall redundancy.
